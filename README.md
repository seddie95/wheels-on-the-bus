# Wheels on the bus

## Introduction to wheels
A website that allows users to select two particular Dublin bus stops and then produce a prediction of how long
the journey will take using  LGBM Artificial  Neural network. This website has been designed to ensure ease of access 
for all users with no need for a sign-in thus protecting users information and ensuring simplicity in use. The "Wheels"
website was designed with mobile and desktop users in mind.

## Background
This Project was conducted as part of the UCD Computer Science masters (conversion) programme as the summer research
practicum. The essence of this practicum was to develop an application that produces accurate dublin bus travel times 
based on historical data provided by RTPI.The project guidelines did not specify how the this was to be achieved thus
allowing free range to us the students to explore a myriad of technologies both front-end and backend.

## Technologies used
The modelling component of the web application was achieved using the LGBM Artificial  Neural network. The backend is 
powered by python and the Django web framework library. The front-end was produced in the most part using vanilla 
javascript aided by jQuery.
